# ParticipantsForm
Mini-project for CodeGorilla Java Bootcamp

2023-03-22:  Received instructions for mini-project.
2023-03-23:  Watched some of the instructional videos for the project.
2023-03-24:  Made Swing GUI interface and getting started in Github.
2023-03-27:  Experimenting the logic part.
             Added constraints to hour- and minuteSpinner.
             Added logic for catching empty input name string or if it's still in the default (initial) state.
2023-03-29 midday-update:  Added Participant class, ArrayList and relocated some form settings from Main to ParticipantsForm,
                           removed some unused imports, added import ArrayList.
2023-03-29:  Added coding comments.
             Added time slot taken check.
             Added text file storage of the participants list. So that the list survives on close window and re-opens in a new window.
             Not quite satisfied with the cleanliness of the code, but it all seems to work nicely
2023-03-29  Final touches.


Program works as intended. Bit messy code, but for now -and with my current level of knowledge in Java- I will consider it done. 
Needs a revisit in the future when I've learned more.
